Began development of Unum 3.0, incorporating the Unicode 11.0.0
database.  The Unicode 11.0.0 announcement is:
    http://blog.unicode.org/2018/06/announcing-unicode-standard-version-110.html

Downloaded the master code point database from:
    https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucdxml/ucd.all.flat.zip

Extracted the code point table with:
    perl cpnames.pl >cpnames.txt
Copied the code point table to the parent directory.    

Extracted the blocks table with:
    perl blocks.pl >blocks.txt
The blocks table is included in the template program,
    not a separate database.  The new blocks in 11.0.0 are:
    [0x1C90, 0x1CBF = 'Georgian Extended'],
    [0x10D00, 0x10D3F = 'Hanifi Rohingya'],
    [0x10F00, 0x10F2F = 'Old Sogdian'],
    [0x10F30, 0x10F6F = 'Sogdian'],
    [0x11800, 0x1184F = 'Dogra'],
    [0x11D60, 0x11DAF = 'Gunjala Gondi'],
    [0x11EE0, 0x11EFF = 'Makasar'],
    [0x16E40, 0x16E9F = 'Medefaidrin'],
    [0x1D2E0, 0x1D2FF = 'Mayan Numerals'],
    [0x1EC70, 0x1ECBF = 'Indic Siyaq Numbers'],
    [0x1FA00, 0x1FA6F = 'Chess Symbols'],

Changed the version number in the template program, unum_t.pl,
to "Version 3.0, July 2018".

Integrated the blocks.txt table into unum_t.pl, replacing the
previous definition of @UNICODE_BLOCKS.

Built the release versions with:
    make all
    
Ran a:
    make check
and the only differences reported were the new additions
to the block table.  Updated the expected text to include
them with:
    cp -p check_rcv.tmp check_exp.txt
and now make check runs with no errors.

The HTML5 named character references table:
    https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/entities.json
has not changed, although the pointy-heads have shuffled
the order of some of the items in the table.  If you sort
the table from last September and the one from today and
compare them, they are identical.  Since we don't care
about the order of the entries, there is no reason to
remake our named character entity tables.

Began development using the Unicode 12.1.0 database
downloaded from:
    https://www.unicode.org/Public/12.1.0/ucdxml/ucd.all.flat.zip

Created a Makefile to rebuild from a new ucd.all.flat.xml
database.

New blocks in Unicode 12.1.0 are:
    [0x10FE0, 0x10FFF = 'Elymaic'],
    [0x119A0, 0x119FF = 'Nandinagari'],
    [0x11FC0, 0x11FFF = 'Tamil Supplement'],
    [0x13430, 0x1343F = 'Egyptian Hieroglyph Format Controls'],
    [0x1B130, 0x1B16F = 'Small Kana Extension'],
    [0x1E100, 0x1E14F = 'Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong'],
    [0x1E2C0, 0x1E2FF = 'Wancho'],
    [0x1ED00, 0x1ED4F = 'Ottoman Siyaq Numbers'],
    [0x1FA70, 0x1FAFF = 'Symbols and Pictographs Extended-A'],

The HTML5 named character references table:
    https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/entities.json
has not changed, although the pointy-heads have shuffled
the order of some of the items in the table.  If you sort
the table from the last time and the one from today and
compare them, they are identical.  Since we don't care
about the order of the entries, there is no reason to
remake our named character entity tables.

Changed the version number in the template program, unum_t.pl,
to "Version 3.1 (12.1.0), January 2019".  Henceforth, the
version number will indicate the Unicode standard which the
database represents.ss

Integrated the blocks.txt table into unum_t.pl, replacing the
previous definition of @UNICODE_BLOCKS.
