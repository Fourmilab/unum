Began development of Unum 3.0, incorporating the Unicode 11.0.0
database.  The Unicode 11.0.0 announcement is:
    http://blog.unicode.org/2018/06/announcing-unicode-standard-version-110.html

Downloaded the master code point database from:
    https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucdxml/ucd.all.flat.zip

Extracted the code point table with:
    perl cpnames.pl >cpnames.txt
Copied the code point table to the parent directory.

Extracted the blocks table with:
    perl blocks.pl >blocks.txt
The blocks table is included in the template program,
    not a separate database.  The new blocks in 11.0.0 are:
    [0x1C90, 0x1CBF = 'Georgian Extended'],
    [0x10D00, 0x10D3F = 'Hanifi Rohingya'],
    [0x10F00, 0x10F2F = 'Old Sogdian'],
    [0x10F30, 0x10F6F = 'Sogdian'],
    [0x11800, 0x1184F = 'Dogra'],
    [0x11D60, 0x11DAF = 'Gunjala Gondi'],
    [0x11EE0, 0x11EFF = 'Makasar'],
    [0x16E40, 0x16E9F = 'Medefaidrin'],
    [0x1D2E0, 0x1D2FF = 'Mayan Numerals'],
    [0x1EC70, 0x1ECBF = 'Indic Siyaq Numbers'],
    [0x1FA00, 0x1FA6F = 'Chess Symbols'],

Changed the version number in the template program, unum_t.pl,
to "Version 3.0, July 2018".

Integrated the blocks.txt table into unum_t.pl, replacing the
previous definition of @UNICODE_BLOCKS.

Built the release versions with:
    make all

Ran a:
    make check
and the only differences reported were the new additions
to the block table.  Updated the expected text to include
them with:
    cp -p check_rcv.tmp check_exp.txt
and now make check runs with no errors.

The HTML5 named character references table:
    https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/entities.json
has not changed, although the pointy-heads have shuffled
the order of some of the items in the table.  If you sort
the table from last September and the one from today and
compare them, they are identical.  Since we don't care
about the order of the entries, there is no reason to
remake our named character entity tables.

2020 January 4

Began development using the Unicode 12.1.0 database
downloaded from:
    https://www.unicode.org/Public/12.1.0/ucdxml/ucd.all.flat.zip

Created a Makefile to rebuild from a new ucd.all.flat.xml
database.

New blocks in Unicode 12.1.0 are:
    [0x10FE0, 0x10FFF = 'Elymaic'],
    [0x119A0, 0x119FF = 'Nandinagari'],
    [0x11FC0, 0x11FFF = 'Tamil Supplement'],
    [0x13430, 0x1343F = 'Egyptian Hieroglyph Format Controls'],
    [0x1B130, 0x1B16F = 'Small Kana Extension'],
    [0x1E100, 0x1E14F = 'Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong'],
    [0x1E2C0, 0x1E2FF = 'Wancho'],
    [0x1ED00, 0x1ED4F = 'Ottoman Siyaq Numbers'],
    [0x1FA70, 0x1FAFF = 'Symbols and Pictographs Extended-A'],

The HTML5 named character references table:
    https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/entities.json
has not changed, although the pointy-heads have shuffled
the order of some of the items in the table.  If you sort
the table from the last time and the one from today and
compare them, they are identical.  Since we don't care
about the order of the entries, there is no reason to
remake our named character entity tables.

Changed the version number in the template program, unum_t.pl,
to "Version 3.1 (12.1.0), January 2020".  Henceforth, the
version number will indicate the Unicode standard which the
database represents.

Integrated the 12.1.0 blocks.txt table into unum_t.pl, replacing
the previous definition of @UNICODE_BLOCKS.

2020 January 5

Added the ability to specify a character as a UTF-8 byte
sequence, coded as a number.  For example:
    unum utf8=0xE298A2
specifies the U+2622 RADIOACTIVE SIGN as a three-byte UTF-8
sequence.  The UTF-8 parser, in function decode_UTF8(), is very
picky and diagnoses encoding errors such as extraneous bytes
after the UTF-8 sequence, continuation as first byte, malformed
continuation bytes, bytes forbidden in UTF-8, and "overlong"
encoding of values in more bytes than required.

Added an option (our first!), --utf8, which adds display of the
UTF-8 encoding of characters as a hexadecimal byte sequence.
The option only affects arguments specified after it on the
command line.

2020 January 7

Added a test to verify that the first byte of a UTF-8 code is
not a continuation which should appear only in subsequent bytes
of a multi-byte code.

2020 May 15

Began development of version 3.2, which will incorporate the
Unicode 13.0 standard:
    https://www.unicode.org/Public/13.0.0/ucdxml/ucd.all.flat.zip

Downloaded into a WORK13.0 directory and rebuilt blocks.txt and
cpnames.txt with "make all".  Copied cpnames.txt into the parent
build directory:
    cp -p cpnames.txt ..

The HTML5 named character reference table has not changed since
the version we incorporate, although as back in January, the
order of the table posted on the W3C site is different, but
sorts into an indentical file.  Since the order is irrelevant
to our processing of the table, for our purposes it is unchanged.

Changed the version number in the template program, unum_t.pl,
to "Version 3.2 (13.0.0), May 2020".  The version number
indicates the Unicode standard which the database represents.

New blocks in Unicode 13.0.0 are:
        [0x10E80, 0x10EBF ='Yezidi'],
        [0x10FB0, 0x10FDF ='Chorasmian'],
        [0x11900, 0x1195F ='Dives Akuru'],
        [0x11FB0, 0x11FBF ='Lisu Supplement'],
        [0x18B00, 0x18CFF ='Khitan Small Script'],
        [0x18D00, 0x18D8F ='Tangut Supplement'],
        [0x1FB00, 0x1FBFF ='Symbols for Legacy Computing'],
        [0x30000, 0x3134F ='CJK Unified Ideographs Extension G'],

Integrated the 13.0.0 blocks.txt table into unum_t.pl, replacing
the previous definition of @UNICODE_BLOCKS.

Updated the pre-dimensioning of the @UNICODE_BLOCKS and
%UNICODE_NAMES array and hash to reflect the number of items in
13.0.  This allows Perl to pre-allocate the array index and hash
buckets for these structures in advance rather than having to
repeatedly expand them as they are initialised.

Rebuilt with:
    make clean
    make all

Ran a "make check".  The only discrepancies reported were, as
expected, the new Unicode blocks in the listing of all blocks.
After verifying that the discrepancies corresponded to the
blocks added in 13.0, I updated the check expected results:
    cp -p check_rcv.tmp check_exp.txt
to include the new blocks and verified that make check now runs
with no errors.

Version 3.2.

2021 May 11

Added a --nent option which causes HTML character entities to
always be displayed as decimal numbers, for example &#8212;,
even if a named character reference exists.  This makes it
easier to generate HTML compatible with older versions that
support fewer named characters.

Version 3.3.
